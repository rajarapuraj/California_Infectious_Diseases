# California_Infectious_Diseases
This project focuses on the analysis and visualization of infectious diseases data reported in California during 2001-2022. It aims to provide a comprehensive summary and visual representation of the dataset using MS-Excel to enhance understanding of the disease patterns and trends.

### Downloading the Dataset
With the keen interest to see the trends on communicable diseases in the United States, I've downloaded an infectious diseases dataset from the [Data.gov](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/infectious-diseases-by-disease-county-year-and-sex-6e856), which was collected by the California Department of Public Health. The data represents cases reported for California residents with an estimated illness from 2001 through 2022.

### Importing the Dataset
As I'm going to use MS-Excel for this project. I've converted the downloaded .csv file into .xlsx file by opening it through the MS-Excel > File > Open and selecting the downloaded file.

This dataset has fields like Disease, County, Year, Cases Reported.

### Clean and Prepare the Data
Each and every dataset should be cleaned and prepared before performing analysis. Data preprocessing is crucial because it ensures data accuracy, consistency, and completeness. Properly cleaned and formatted data always prevents errors and biases, leading to more reliable insights and effective visual representations. 

Basic preprocessing steps include are:
1. Inspecting the Data
2. Removing of Unnecessary Columns
3. Handling Missing Data
4. Formatting Data Types

Note: Without preprocessing, the analysis may yield misleading results.

Here, the dataset has been already preprocessed. Thus, the analysis and visualizations will be based on high-quality data, leading to reliable and meaningful insights.

### Analyze the Data
As a first step in analysis, I've created a PivotTable by dropping the fields into Rows, Columns, Values, and Filter areas to summarize the data. Then, I used filters in the PivotTable to focus on specific subsets of data to answer questions like:

1. In which year the highest number of cases reported?
2. Which county of California reported highest cases?
3. Which disease cases are high?

### Visualize the Data
While PivotTables are excellent for summarizing and aggregating data, their drawback lies in their static nature and limited visual representation. So, with the PivotTable creation complete, now I'm proceeding to visualize the data to uncover patterns and trends effectively.

### Conclusion
In conclusion, the year 2014 saw a notable increase in reported cases of infectious diseases across California, with California City reporting a significant 72,192 cases. Among these diseases, Pertussis emerged as particularly prevalent and highly communicable among residents statewide. These findings underscore the ongoing importance of robust public health measures and vaccination efforts to mitigate the impact of infectious diseases in California.

### Recommendations
To address these findings, California Public Health Department should enhance vaccination coverage and public awareness campaigns about preventive measures for Pertussis. Additionally, strengthening surveillance systems and healthcare infrastructure can help effectively manage and reduce the incidence of infectious diseases across California.
